# AmongUs

## A template repo for new projects at FAR AI

This repo provides a minimal structure we can reuse when setting up a new research project at FAR AI. The goal is to reduce technical setup time and to collect a set of good practices for common elements of a project pipeline such as manipulating experiment configs and running batch jobs.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo and go into the main directory.
1. Create a new virtual environment called `venv`:

    `virtualenv --python=3.10 venv`
1. Activate the virtual environment:

    `source venv/bin/activate`
1. Install the package in editable mode, with `dev` dependencies:

    `pip install -e '.[dev]'`
1. Add [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks for various linting tasks by installing pre-commit:

    `pre-commit install`

## Running

### Local

To run locally, simply run the `main.py` script. To run with default arguments, use:

```python main.py```

You can also specify config options with the CLI, using dot-separated keys corresponding to the config structure defined in `AmongUs/configs.py`. For example:

```python main.py training.learning_rate=0.01```

(Note no `--` before the `training.learning_rate`.)

You can also pass configs via JSON strings or YAML files. For the full range of options, see the [`farconf` README](https://github.com/AlignmentResearch/farconf).

### Running on a k8s devbox

Devboxes are used for developing and running very quick experiments in an environment that matches that of k8s batch jobs, which are discussed in the next section.
Devboxes are not meant for heavy-duty experiments.

To run on a k8s devbox, you need to first launch a devbox and access it. See section TODO below and optionally the [flamingo docs](https://github.com/AlignmentResearch/flamingo/tree/main/examples/devbox) for more information. After accessing the devbox, you can run as in the previous section.

### Batch jobs on k8s

Large-scale or long-running experiments should be run as k8s batch jobs. Benefits of batch jobs include:
- the cluster will schedule jobs when resources are available, and it will free jobs' resources when they complete,
- no need to manually maintain a devbox or otherwise babysit the jobs,
- it's easy to run multiple independent runs with a single command (using our scripts).

We use Python files as configs for experiments to be run as k8s batch jobs. (Each experiment can contain multiple runs. See section TODO below.) An example experiment config is provided as `experiments/jd/jd_000_simple_example.py`. In order to run it, use:

```python experiments/jd/jd_000_simple_example.py```

This command will launch the jobs on the cluster. To instead only generate and print k8s job configs, set `dry_run=True` in the config file.

We provide tools to easily create hyperparameter grid searches; see `experiments/jd/jd_000_simple_example.py` for an example.

## Validating the code

### Tests
You can run all tests using:

```pytest AmongUs/tests```

### Linting

You can run linters on all project files with:

```pre-commit run --all-files```

Additionally, when committing, linters will be run on the modified files.

### CircleCI

Reasonable defaults for CircleCI are already set up in the repo. To activate it for your new project, go to [our CircleCI page](https://circleci.com/gh/AlignmentResearch/), log in via GitHub if needed, click "Set Up Project" under your project, and select the "Fastest" option.

## Configs

### Runs and experiments
Throughout the project, we use the terms "run" and "project".
- "run" is a single experimental run, something that'd typically use a single process, e.g., training a single model;
- "experiment" corresponds to what we typically think of as an "experiment" in a research project. It is meant to accomplish a single conceptual goal but possibly using multiple runs, e.g., a grid search of training runs.

### Run configs
We use dataclasses (which can be nested and use inheritance) for our configs, with `RunConfig` being the main config class, see `AmongUs/configs.py`. Because of this (and using [farconf](https://github.com/AlignmentResearch/farconf) library), we have type checking for our configs. For example, when you make a typo when specifying command line arguments, this will be often caught before running an experiment.

### Experiment configs
We use a single Python file to define an experiment (possibly containing multiple runs). See `experiments/jd/jd_000_simple_example.py` for an example.

We suggest keeping all historical experiment configs in the repo as project documentation and not modifying them after committing. We also suggest a simple naming convention; for an experiment authored by John Doe, we call the file `experiments/jd/jd_<NUMBER>_<SHORT_DESCRIPTION>.py`; see more details in the comments inside `experiments/jd/jd_000_simple_example.py`.

## TODOs / known issues

- [ ] add a simple bash script to quickly make it into `your_cool_project` repo (replace `AmongUs` with `your_cool_project` everywhere, etc)
- [ ] look into GitHub template repositories, is it useful for us?
- [ ] add instructions for setting up / adding shared volume for the project
- [ ] make sure to use only "stable" apis from farconf, or use explicit version in reqs
- [ ] kaniko: fix the case when branch name contains "/"; enable easier passing of branch name?
- [ ] add README section about building docker images
- [ ] remove pandas dependency (rewrite `flatten_dict`)
- [ ] in future: move batch jobs logic to a separate library?
- [ ] explain better what happens in Dockerfile (e.g. users/permissions)
- [ ] replace black, isort, flake8 with ruff
- [ ] add instructions on what to do when copying into a new repo. In particular, pin requirements versions
- [ ] consider adding (maybe simplified) Makefile [like this one](https://github.com/AlignmentResearch/learned-planners/blob/main/Makefile)
